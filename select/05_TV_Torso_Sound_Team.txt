Don't let them lie you down on a dharna
Oh, hit "Someday"
You fall into the room
From on a top-floor ledge did you fall
Let the ladder down let it down now
Oh it's so good
Lying to you
Forage you look for a dozen dollars

Led you down another tunnel
Told a lie
I got to get it back I got to get it done
I know brave men brave men brave men always run
Down and then done into
Down and then done into
What do we turn into
What do we turn into
I did it too

Oh accidents and damage
Words fall on our attic door
And I found out that I let you down

Why don't you tell her now what you don't know
There's no hype
When you die
Down and then done into
What do we turn into

Oh at the end of something
Words fall out of the attic door
I found out I let you down

Oh I got tired of telling
