I keep two eyes on the prize
I got my minds on my methods
I stay reminded of crime
So keep a chain on your wallet
I dont keep weed in a jar
Cuz it keeps on killing itself
So I keep on shooting at stars
Now It's hard to keep to myself
Psych ward talking walls
Going bonkers keep it funky
Full fledged Cali-fornicator
Mexi-melt mix procreator
Player hater
Middle east to middle west
Out the little earth
Mighty red lake river nation
Out the jungles from the shoreline
Came from the hills down to the killing fields
Bear witness the war time
Crawled into an LA gutter
Lost a mother left a father
Say that I was raised by the water
Cuz sherm made the late 80's harder
(bubble bubble) Sizzle crackle pop
Re-rock pump up the block
Like reeboks at halftime
Chip that bag dead that kids high before they wake up detox'd
That's not a g spot
Real G's keep their knees locked
72 hour hold
72 hour hold
5150
Homie where the fuck did I go?
Hand cuffs with no links
Zip ties in my kicks
Got that look in my face
Like I took the wrong meds
Ugh

50G bail
50G bail
One hundred and eighty-seven on any cop who wanna put me in jail

and I ain't bluffin I ain't bluffin deeeeeek
What?
I ain't bluffin I ain't bluffin deeeeeek
What?
I'm barely, I'm barely livin off this rap shit
I'm barely, I'm barely livin off this rap

Linked up like Cubans
Wrapped in a crocodile
and I ain't from Cuilliacaun
but I'll cut a head off fool in a pool of blood to the god Mictlan
Now 15 of them and they closest
Die alone no one noticed
They totem pole has a hole at the very lowest
They modus operandis is bogus
My zone is Oderus Urungus
Get the Balzac - Jizmac
Beefcake Nutz Humungous
Mug, we Maximus
Practice raps in plastic wrapped packages
Not a sack of crack around us
C-c-c cookin up classic tracks
Sell a t shirt get the reverse
Clothes on my back deeeeeg
Feel the ether now the rebirth
Hit a show go reup queeeek
Pity why go whistle
Fuck a city throw the middle
Fuckem all and blaze a missile
Hit em up when they ain't lookin
Or hit em when they lookin crooked, sthe crook took his shooter
Killed a pimp freed his hooker
Made the dealer choke his cooker
Make the priest give up the robe
Give the mayor my regards
I can't get outta this hole hard
So tell em all I keep my fuckin eyes on the prize
I got my minds on my methods
Stay reminded of crime
So keep a chain on your wallet
I dont keep weed in a jar
It keeps on killing itself
and I keep on lighting up tar
thats hard to keep to myself
