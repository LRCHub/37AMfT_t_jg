It whispers the sweet things
It says the sweet things
It takes you by the wrist
Twists your arms behind your back

The storm in your eyes
Suggests an inner calm
Soul sleeps, soul snakes
Soul sleeps and soul snakes

The blood from her neck
Frames her head like a halo
Pony tail hangin' down
I've got you upside down

Washed up on the beach
You were wet and you were drowned
Memory believes before
Knowing remembers

Memory believes longer than recollects
Longer than knowing even wonders
