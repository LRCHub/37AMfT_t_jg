Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Why you dress like me is it honesty or you just a fool
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Why the school kids laugh cause the papers got it wrong again
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Take a piece of me serve me up on a plate in your restaurant

Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?

Is it 'cos I'm fly
'Cos I said what I said when I said what I said but I didn't say
Is it 'cos I'm hip
Why you dig my shit and you say I am a fan now I understand
Is it 'cos I'm hot
Why you mention me in your V.I.P memories

Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?

I ain't buying or selling today
I'm just looking around
For some decent conversation
No hidden agenda
No phony pretender
No holding on out for my sweet sixteen
Or peppermint dream
I'll call you please don't call me

Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?

Is it 'cos I'm Smart
Why you break my heart with the lies you tell baby kiss and tell
Is it 'cos I'm wrong
That you jump right in with no discipline baby sink or swim
Is it 'cos we're friends
Why you use my name just to entertain eh-yeah

Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?

Time keeps ticking and running away
And It's taking us fast to a brand new free dimension
Too cool to mention well that's the intention
But some of us too damn blind to see
It's setting us free
Say goodbye to jealousy

Is it 'cos I'm cool?
No one really cooler
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Take a piece of me
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Why you mention me
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
In your VIP
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos Am cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
